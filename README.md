# Python Practice

This repository contains my daily Python practice code as part of my Juneâ€“July learning plan.

### Topics I'm covering:
- Python basics (variables, loops, lists, functions)
- Problem-solving exercises
- Mini-projects using ML and ChatGPT API (coming soon!)

I'll be updating this repo daily as I learn and build. ðŸš€
